# MaSzyna-API-wrapper

## About the project

This C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine offers a simplified interface to the MaSzyna train simulator API. Tailored for the MaSzyna Reloaded project, it enables developers to construct train components using Godot's Node-based system, providing a visual and intuitive approach to train creation and management. Key features include:

- Custom Node-based Classes: Create train elements using our premade and integrated classes based on Godot's familiar Node system.
- Parameter Customization: Fine-tune train parameters directly within the Godot editor.
- Simplified Integration: Seamlessly integrate the MaSzyna simulator physics into your Godot projects.
- Enhanced Debugging: Streamline the debugging process for your train simulations.

### Setup

1. Install Python 3
2. Install scons using `pip install scons`
3. Install [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/)
For a better reference see: for [windows](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html) and for [linux](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html)
4. Clone the repository and checkout submodules
```
git clone <url>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Code Quality

FIles on PRs are scanned by Qodana. All it's reports are published [here](https://qodana.cloud/projects/ARjJ6)

### Testing

#### Testing locally

First, ensure you have checked out submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Then run tests from the command line (if you have `make` installed, you can use shortcut `make run-tests`):

```bash
godot --path demo --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests/ -gexit
```


Or use Godot Editor, but before that ensure you have configured test dirs.
GUT is storing the config in `user://` filesystem, so you have to do this manually.

Then run all tests:

#### Testing using docker

From the command line, build the image first:

```bash
docker build-t godot-tests .
```

then run the image:

```bash
docker run --rm godot-tests
```

If you have `make`, you can simply use the shortcut `make docker-run-tests`.
